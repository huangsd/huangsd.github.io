I am looking for self-motivated students who are interested in tackling optimization for machine learning, inlcuding auto machine learning, neural architecture search, neuro evolution, evolutionary computation, gradient-free large-scale optimization, multi/many-objective optimization, and their high-performance implementations on GPU. If you are interested in joining my group, please send me your CV, transcripts, and any demonstration materials such as papers or drafts.</p>
<h1>Short Bio</h1>
<p>Yanan Sun is a Professor (research) in the College of Computer Science at Sichuan University, China. Before that, he was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the School of Engineering and Computer Science at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand from July 2017 to March 2019. He received his PhD degree from the College of Computer Science at Sichuan University in China in June 2017. From August 2015 to February 2017, he studied in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Oklahoma State University in the USA, as a joint PhD student financed by China Scholar Council. </p>
