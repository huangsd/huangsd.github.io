Welcome to my homepage! \
I'm currently an associate professor (副教授/博导) with the College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China. I'm also a member of [DICALab](https://dicalab.cn/) (Data Intelligence and Computing Arts Lab), which is led by Prof. [Jiancheng Lv](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1303/13767.htm). I obtained my Ph.D. degree from School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in Dec. 2019, where I was very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Zenglin Xu](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/xuzenglin). 

I have broad interest in *Representation Learning*, *Machine Learning*, *Data Mining* and their potential applications to multimedia data. I am specifically interested in
- **Representation Learning**: developing *unified theory* in data mining, computer vision, natural language processing, etc;
- **Unsupervised/Semi-supervised Learning**: learning from unlabeled/and few labeled data;
- **Multiview/Multimodal learning**: learning from data represented by multiple views/modals;
- **Online/Lifelong Learning**: learning models continuously from online streaming/continuous data;
- **Deep Learning**: leveraging deep learning frameworks, including deep neural networks, deep matrix factorization, deep forest, and so on, to handle complex learning tasks;
- **Federated Learning**: learning models in a privacy-preserving decentralized collaborative way, considering the data isolation, privacy as well as security;
- **AI for Science (AI4Science)**: exploring the intersections of multiple disciplines including applied mathematics/physics/chemistry/biology, astronomy, geography, dynamical systems, logical reasoning, machine learning, etc. Our team specifically focuses on boosting scientific simulation/calculation with AI & ML, incorporating physical insights to AI methods, and modelling the (continuous) dynamical systems (generally differential equations approximation problems) with AI & ML.
